My Thematic Apps
================

Create an app
-------------

From the thematic app page, the user (specific users only) has also the ability to create its own Thematic App, clicking on **+ Create new** on the top right of the applications list.

The user can:
	
	- load an existing thematic app, providing his url (in atom format)
	- create a new thematic app from scratch

Finally the user can save this thematic application in his private catalogue index.

.. NOTE: 
	Administrator can select the index in which to save the application.

If there is already an entry with the same identifier in the index, the entry will be overwritten with the new one.
Once created, the application is accessible from the Thematic app discovery page.
