Fill in parameters
------------------

A processing service takes as input a list of parameters, which are defined in the DescribeProcess function of the WPS service.
Parameters can be free text or can be selected from a list of possible values. When a default value is described in the DescribeProcess, it is automatically set in the parameter field and can of course be changed by the user if he wants to.
Besides, some specific parameters can be filled directly from the geobrowser:

- data input or files can be directly dragged from the Result tab or from the basket and dropped into the parameter input,
- geographic input (bounding box) value can be taken from the bbox selected on the map by clicking on the |get_param_from_map_button.png| button,
- temporal input (start date, end date) can be taken from the time bar selection by clicking on the |get_param_from_map_button.png| button,
