This tutorial processes a pair of Sentinel-1 TOPSAR IW data with the SNAP S1 TOPS-IW COherence and INtensity service. 
SNAP (SeNtinel Application Platform) [#f1]_ is the common architecture for all Sentinel Toolboxes which is ideal for Earth Observation processing and analysis. It has been jointly developed by Brockmann Consult, Array Systems Computing and C-S.
The coherence and intensity processing chain for Sentinel 1 TOPSAR IW images is implemented through the tools contained in the Sentinel-1 Toolbox.

This tutorial is referred to the service build V1.2.0.

The Coherence and Intensity change
==================================

The coherence between an images pair can show if the images have strong similarities, represented in a scale from 0 to 1. Areas of high coherence will appear bright (values near 1). Areas with poor coherence will be dark (values near 0). For example, vegetation and water have poor coherence and buildings have very high coherence.

The intensity represents the strength of the radar response from the observed scene. Such intensity can vary dependent on changes occurred in time between the acquisitions and also on the scene physical characteristics. 
To better detect the intensity change this service provides, in addition to the intensity in dB of the individual images, the dB average and dB difference of the image pair.

Also a couple of results combination are provided: 

* An RGB image with Red = Coherence, Green = Intensity average, Blue =  Intensity difference. Thanks to this representation is possible to show changes that occurred within the time coverage related to the couple of acquisitions. The blue can represent water (i.e. lakes, rivers), but also strong changes in bodies of water or agricultural activities such as ploughing. Yellow represents urban centres, which have high coherence and intensity. Green can represent vegetated fields and forests. The reds and oranges represent unchanging features such as bare soil or possibly rocks.

* An RGB image with Red = Master Intensity, Green = Blue = Slave Intensity. Thanks to this representation is possible to clearly show inundated areas in red.

Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath Products
==============================================

The Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode is the main acquisition mode over land for Sentinel-1. It acquires data with a 250 km swath at 5 m by 20 m spatial resolution (single look). IW mode captures three sub-swaths using Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR (TOPSAR). With the TOPSAR technique, in addition to steering the beam in range as in ScanSAR, the beam is also electronically steered from backward to forward in the azimuth direction for each burst, avoiding scalloping and resulting in homogeneous image quality throughout the swath. TOPSAR mode replaces the conventional ScanSAR mode, achieving the same coverage and resolution as ScanSAR, but with a nearly uniform SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and DTAR (Distributed Target Ambiguity Ratio). IW SLC products contain one image per sub-swath and one per polarisation channel, for a total of three (single polarisation) or six (dual polarisation) images in an IW product. Each sub-swath image consists of a series of bursts, where each burst has been processed as a separate SLC image. The individually focused complex burst images are included, in azimuth time order, into a single sub-swath image with black-fill demarcation in between, similar to ENVISAT ASAR Wide ScanSAR SLC products.

The tutorial uses a pair of Sentinel-1 TOPSAR IW data around Rome of June 2016.

The processing service code is available in the GitHub repository `geohazards-tep/dcs-rss-snap-s1-coin <https://github.com/geohazards-tep/dcs-rss-snap-s1-coin>`_.

The "SNAP Sentinel-1 COherence and INtensity (COIN)" panel is displayed with parameters values to be filled-in.


Select the files to process
---------------------------

This service takes as input a couple of Sentinel-1 TOPSAR-IW SLC images.
One image is selected to be the **Master** one, i.e. the reference product on which the other one (the **Slave**) is reprojected and resampled to compute the interferometric coherence and the backscatter intensities. 

Input SAR data selection must be carried out with particular care, since a wrong data selection can result to an unfeasible processing.

* The processing service accepts as inputs **only Sentinel-1 Single Look Complex (i.e. Level 1 SLC) data**.
* The Sentinel-1 SLC pair must pertain to the same acquisition mode **TOPSAR-IW**.
* The user must select **images related to the same track only**. 
* The user must select **images related to the same polarization only**. 
* Spatial overlap is strictly needed between the images pair.

For this tutorial, a pre-defined data set has been prepared to speed up data selection step.

Product polarisation
==================== 

This is the product polarization related to the input data pair. The Sentinel-1 acquisitions on can have different polarization types:
	* **Vertical dual-polarization (DV data)**: Vertical in trasmission phase and both Vertical and Horizontal in receiving phase (This is the most operated one).
	* **Horizontal dual-polarization (DH data)**: Horizontal in trasmission phase and both Horizontal and Vertical in receiving phase.	
	* **Vertical single-polarization (SV data)**: Vertical in both trasmission and receiving phases.
	* **Horizontal single-polarization (SH data)**: Horizontal in both trasmission and receiving phases.
COIN processes only one polarization channel between that can be selected between:
	* **VV**: Vertical in both trasmission and receiving phases, contained in DV and SV products (default value).
	* **VH**: Vertical in trasmission phase and Horizontal in receiving phase, contained only in DV products.
	* **HH**: Horizontal in both trasmission and receiving phases, contained in DH and SH products.
	* **HV**: Horizontal in trasmission phase and Vertical in receiving phase, contained only in DH products.

**For this run leave the VV default value**.	

Orbit type 
==========

The orbit state vectors provided in the metadata of a SAR product are generally not accurate and can be refined with the precise orbit files which are available days-to-weeks after the generation of the product. 
The orbit file provides accurate satellite position and velocity information. Based on this information, the orbit state vectors in the abstract metadata of the product are updated.
A more accurate satellite position and velocity information ensure a better accuracy in the images terrain correction processing.
For Sentinel-1 the following orbit files can be applied: 

	* **Sentinel Precise** (default value). Precise orbits are produced a few weeks after acquisition.
	* **Sentinel Restituted**. Less accurate than Precise but available sooner than the Precise. 	

**For this run leave the Sentinel Restituted (Auto Download) default value**.

Azimuth and Range coherence window size
=======================================

The input parameters are size of the shifting window for the coherence estimation. The window size is defined, in both azimuth and range directions.
* **Azimuth coherence window size**: leave **5** as the default value.
* **Range coherence window size**: leave **20** as the default value.

DEM type
========

Define the DEM source for the Back-Geocoding Coregistration and Terrain Correction processing.
The **SRTM 3 Sec** (90 m of resolution) is used. 
NOTE: SRTM valid in the [-56 deg,+60 deg] range of latitudes.

Azimuth and Range Multilook factor
==================================

Generally, a SAR original image appears speckled with inherent speckle noise. To reduce this inherent speckled appearance, several images are incoherently combined as if they corresponded to different looks of the same scene. This processing is generally known as multilook processing. As a result the multilooked image improves the image interpretability. 
The implemented multilooking technique is the spatial one, produced by space-domain averaging of a single look image.
The selectable parameters are the number of azimuth and range looks. 

* **Azimuth Multilook factor**: leave **2** as the default value.
* **Range Multilook factor**: leave **8** as the default value.

Pixel spacing in meters
=======================

Due to topographical variations of a scene and the tilt of the satellite sensor, distances can be distorted in the SAR images. Image data not directly at the sensor Nadir location will have some distortion. Terrain corrections are intended to compensate for these distortions so that the geometric representation of the image will be as close as possible to the real world.
Terrain Correction allows geometric overlays of data from different sensors and/or geometries.

The user can select the pixel spacing in meters of the terrain corrected image.

* **Pixel spacing in meters**: leave **30.0** as the default value.

Warning on visualization products extent
========================================

For some selected input SLC pairs it can happen that not all the bursts are overlapping. In these cases the SNAP default behavior is: 

* the coeherence band is computed only on the overlapping area; 
* the intensity for Slave bursts that don't overlap with Master ones is dropped; 
* the intensity for Master bursts with no overlap is kept. 

This leads to have a Master with a wider domain than Slave, impacting on the backscatter average and difference products (i.e. average and difference computed also in areas where Slave is not present). 

This problem is fixed for the visualization products **(combined_coh_sigmaAvrg_sigmaDiff_IW_*_FullRes.tif, combined_coh_sigmaAvrg_sigmaDiff_IW_*_QL.png, sigmaDiff_dB_IW_*.png, sigmaAverage_dB_IW_*.png, combined_sigmaMaster_dB_sigmaSlave_dB_IW_*_FullRes.tif, combined_sigmaMaster_dB_sigmaSlave_dB_IW_*_QL.png)** by producing output with the minumum extent (i.e. the same as coherence product) to avoid visualization artifacts. 
In the other products all the available data is kept, so the product extent can slightly differ from Master to Slave. 
		
Warning on output products deletion
===================================

Please note that the generated output (in particular the GeoTIFF products) are not stored in a persistent manner on the platform. 
The Tiff products will be automatically deleted after two weeks.
